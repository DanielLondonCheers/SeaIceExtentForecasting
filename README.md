# Sea Ice Extent Forecasting
This repository contains the code used to generate probabilistic seasonal forecasts of regional and pan-Arctic September sea ice extent, in line with the Sea Ice Prediction Network's annual calls for submissions. The method is based on Complex Networks and Gaussian Process Regression, as outlined in the article by [Gregory et al., 2020](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10091542/1/Gregory_wafd190107.pdf)

Each python script can be executed on the first day of June, July, August, or September each year, where it will subsequently download the relevant data and generate pan-Arctic and Alaska predictions of the following September sea ice extents for the current year.
