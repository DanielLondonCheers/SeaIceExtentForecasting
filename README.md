# SeaIceForecasting
This repository contains the code used to generate forecasts of regional and pan-Arctic September sea ice extent using Complex Networks and Gaussian Process Regression, as outlined in the article by Gregory et al., 2020 - see https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10091542/1/Gregory_wafd190107.pdf

The code to generate Complex Networks of geospatial data is presented in the file CN.py, and is imported directly into the forecast code forecast_SIE.py
