# Sea Ice Extent Forecasting
This repository contains the code used to generate forecasts of regional and pan-Arctic September sea ice extent using Complex Networks and Gaussian Process Regression, as outlined in the article by [Gregory et al., 2020](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10091542/1/Gregory_wafd190107.pdf)

The code to generate Complex Networks of sea ice concentration data, and other examples is in the repository [ComplexNetworks](https://github.com/William-gregory/ComplexNetworks/), and is imported directly into the forecast code forecast_SIE.py
